Here’s a ready-to-use prompt you can paste into Replit AI 👇

You are an expert full-stack web developer.  
Build a **“Campus Music”** web application: a dark-themed music platform for university students and student musicians.

GOAL  
Create a responsive web app similar in feel to **Apple Music / Spotify** (dark UI, big artwork tiles, carousels, sticky audio player) but focused ONLY on university students worldwide. The core idea: student artists upload their music, and other students discover, stream, and share it – without competing directly with mainstream artists.

TECH STACK  
- Full-stack JavaScript app in a single Replit project.  
- Use **React** (with a component-based structure) for the front end.  
- Use **Node.js + Express** for the back end API.  
- Use **SQLite or PostgreSQL** (whichever is easier on Replit) for persistent data.  
- Use **Tailwind CSS** or simple CSS modules for styling with a modern dark theme.  
- Use the built-in HTML5 `<audio>` element for playback with a global sticky player.

AUTHENTICATION & UNIVERSITY LOGIC  
- Implement **email/password auth** plus session or JWT-based login.  
- **Very important:** Only allow sign-ups from **university emails ending in `.edu`**.  
  - If the email does NOT end in `.edu`, show a clear error message:  
    “Campus Music is currently available only to university students with .edu email addresses.”  
- Basic password rules (min 8 characters).  
- Users can reset password via a fake flow (no real email sending needed; just UI and mock behavior).

USER ROLES & MODELS  
Create these main database models (tables) and basic relationships:

1. **User**
   - id, fullName, email, passwordHash, universityName, country, role (`"listener"` or `"artist"`), createdAt.
2. **ArtistProfile**
   - id, userId (FK to User), stageName, bio, mainGenre, socialLinks (JSON), profileImageUrl.
3. **Track**
   - id, artistId (FK to ArtistProfile), title, description, audioUrl (or local file path), coverImageUrl, genre, universityName, country, durationSeconds, createdAt.
4. **Playlist**
   - id, userId (FK), name, description, isPublic, createdAt.
5. **PlaylistTrack**
   - id, playlistId, trackId, addedAt.
6. **Like**
   - id, userId, trackId, createdAt.
7. **Stream**
   - id, userId, trackId, playedAt.

Seed the DB with some **fake universities, artists, and tracks** so that the UI looks alive.

CORE FEATURES – MVP  

1. **Landing / Home Page (after login)**
   - Dark theme similar to Apple Music / Spotify.  
   - Left sidebar navigation (fixed):
     - Home
     - New Releases
     - Campus Charts
     - Discover by University
     - My Library
     - Profile / Settings
   - Main content area with sections inspired by Apple Music:
     - “Best of Campus 2025” – horizontal carousel of curated playlists or albums with large artwork tiles.
     - “Latest Songs” – vertical list of newest tracks (title, artist, university, play button, three-dot menu).
     - “Trending on Campus” – grid or carousel of most-streamed tracks in the last 7 days.
   - Top bar:
     - App logo “Campus Music”
     - Search bar
     - Small user avatar / menu.

2. **New Releases Page**
   - Grid of the most recently uploaded tracks and EPs, using big cover art tiles (similar to the Apple Music “New Releases” screenshot).  
   - Each tile: cover image, title, artist, small university tag, hover play button.

3. **Trending Songs Page**
   - List or grid of tracks sorted by number of streams and likes.  
   - Show ranking numbers (1, 2, 3, …), track name, artist, university, play icon, like count.

4. **Discover by University**
   - Dropdown or search box to select a **university** (text search).  
   - When a university is selected:
     - Show “Top Artists from [University]”
     - Show “Top Tracks from [University]”
     - Show “New from [University]”
   - Use the `universityName` field in ArtistProfile/Track to filter.

5. **Artist Experience**
   - Any logged-in user can click “Become an Artist” in their profile:
     - Opens a form to create an **ArtistProfile** (stage name, genres, bio, links, profile image).  
   - Artist dashboard:
     - Button to **upload a track**:
       - Fields: title, description, genre, upload audio file (mp3), upload cover image, optional lyrics text.
       - Automatically tags the track with the user’s `universityName` and `country`.
     - List of their tracks with basic stats:
       - Play count (from Streams table)
       - Likes
       - Upload date.

6. **Listener Experience / My Library**
   - “Liked Songs” – all tracks the user has liked.
   - Custom playlists:
     - Create, rename, delete playlists.
     - Add/remove tracks from context menus or three-dot menus.
   - Recently played list.

7. **Global Audio Player**
   - A **persistent bottom bar** (sticky across pages) similar to Spotify:
     - Shows currently playing track art, title, artist, university.
     - Play/pause, previous, next.
     - Seek bar and volume control.
   - Clicking play on any track updates this global player.

8. **Search**
   - Search bar at the top that lets users search by:
     - track title
     - artist stage name
     - university name
     - genre  
   - Results page with tabs or sections for Tracks, Artists, Universities.

9. **Profile & Settings**
   - User can view and edit:
     - full name
     - university name
     - country
     - change password  
   - If role = artist, also show quick link to Artist Dashboard and ArtistProfile.

UI & UX REQUIREMENTS  
- Dark theme, inspired by **Apple Music** & **Spotify**:
  - Dark gray/black background
  - Bright accent color for buttons and highlights.
- Layout:
  - Left vertical sidebar navigation.
  - Scrollable main content with multiple horizontal carousels (use horizontal scrolling lists with album/track tiles).
- Each track card / tile:
  - Cover image (square)
  - Title and artist
  - Small label for university (e.g., “DePaul University, USA”)
  - Hover or visible play button.
- Make the site fully responsive:  
  - On mobile, sidebar becomes a top/bottom nav bar.  
  - Carousels become swipeable horizontal lists.

BACKEND API ENDPOINTS (examples)  
Create REST endpoints such as:
- `POST /api/auth/signup` – validate `.edu` email, create user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/me` – current user.
- `PUT /api/me` – update profile.
- `POST /api/artist` – create/update artist profile.
- `GET /api/tracks` – list tracks (with filters for new, trending, university, etc.).
- `POST /api/tracks` – artist uploads track metadata + file.
- `POST /api/tracks/:id/like` and `DELETE /api/tracks/:id/like`
- `POST /api/tracks/:id/stream` – record a play.
- `GET /api/playlists`, `POST /api/playlists`, `POST /api/playlists/:id/tracks`

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES  
- For file uploads in Replit, you can either:
  - store audio/cover files in a local `uploads/` folder and reference their URLs, OR  
  - mock the uploads and use placeholder URLs.  
- Include clear comments in the code so it’s easy to extend.  
- Seed script: on server start, if DB is empty, create several sample universities, users (with .edu emails), artists, and tracks so the UI looks populated.

FINAL DELIVERABLE  
- A working full-stack Campus Music web app running in Replit with:
  - .edu-only sign up & login
  - artist and listener flows
  - Apple Music / Spotify-style dark UI with carousels and a sticky audio player
  - pages: Home, New Releases, Trending, Discover by University, My Library, Profile.
- Include instructions in the README on:
  - how to run the app,
  - default demo logins for testing (e.g., demo@demo.edu / password123).

Focus on clean, modular code and a polished UI that feels close to Apple Music / Spotify but clearly branded as “Campus Music.”
